<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pump Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pump Devices</li><li>Extracorporeal Heart Pump Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart pump devices market consists of two primary types: implantable heart pump devices and extracorporeal heart pump devices. Implantable heart pumps, such as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), are surgically placed within the body to support heart function in patients with severe heart disease. Extracorporeal heart pumps, on the other hand, are external devices that temporarily support circulation, often used during surgeries or in critical care settings. Both categories play crucial roles in managing heart failure and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
