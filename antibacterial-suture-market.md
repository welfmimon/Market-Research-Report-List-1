<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antibacterial Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Suture</li><li>Non-Absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antibacterial suture market comprises two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures are designed to break down naturally in the body over time, eliminating the need for removal, making them ideal for internal applications. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, remain intact and are often used for external wound closure, requiring removal after healing. Both types are treated with antibacterial agents to reduce the risk of infection, enhancing patient safety and recovery outcomes in surgical procedures.</p></p>
