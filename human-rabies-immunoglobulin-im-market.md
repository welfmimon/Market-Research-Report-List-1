<p><strong>The Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (IM) Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Category II Exposure</li><li>Category III Exposure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG) is crucial for post-exposure prophylaxis in rabies prevention. In Category II exposure, which includes bites or scratches from an animal potentially rabid but without bleeding, HRIG serves as an adjunct to vaccination to enhance immunity. Category III exposure, involving significant bites or scratches, requires HRIG administration alongside vaccination to provide immediate passive immunity. The market for HRIG is driven by the necessity for effective post-exposure treatments in regions with high rabies incidence.</p></p>
